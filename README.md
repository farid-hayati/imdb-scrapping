# imdb-scrapping

This is a small project to extract movie data by web-scrapping on [IMDB website](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=movie&genres=animation&sort=boxoffice_gross_us,desc&explore=title_type,genres) using Python & BeautifulSoup. 

For the moment, I am extracting the top grossing animation films. This is a personal choice since I love animation films & noticed there is lack of data in this genre. 

As the great Academy winning director, Guillmore del Toro, once said: 
>"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art, it's a medium for film."
